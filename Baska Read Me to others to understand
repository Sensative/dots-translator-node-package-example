Hello, it is Baska's read me file. See below instructions:

Option#1   -  node RadarConfigurator.js 5 300 0.3 3

Option#2 -    node RadarConfigurator.js 3 s 0.5 5 0.65


Explaination of the parameter:

A) 3 (Radar App Mode)

This selects radar mode 3, which is for Well Monitoring.
Other modes:
3 → Well Monitoring
4 → Bin Monitoring
5 → Parking Monitoring
6 → Seating Monitoring

B) 300 (Measurement Cycle in seconds)

This sets the measurement cycle to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
The radar will take readings every 5 minutes.

C) 0.5 (Start Range in meters)

The radar starts detecting objects 0.5 meters away.
D) 5 (End Range in meters)

The radar will stop detecting objects beyond 5 meters.

E) 0.65 (Sensitivity Level - 0 to 1)

This sets the radar's sensitivity to 0.65 (on a scale from 0 to 1).
A higher value makes the radar more sensitive to small objects.
